Explanations and instructions for LXARDOSCOPE breadboard schematic ATmega328simple.png **************************************************************************************

1. 5V power supply needs to be floating with respect to PC GND (cannot use PC's USB supply directly).
2. GNDArduino is -2.5V WRT GNDPC
3. VCCArduino is +2.5 WRT GNDPC
4. range of A0 and A1 in this setup is from -2.5 to +2.5V WRT GNDPC
5. for A0 connected to GNDPC, sample value is 512 (theoretically)
6. Note that TX needs to be inverted before reaching PC serial port.
7. PC serial port signal needs to be bipolar (+/-2.5V in the example above);
	I do not know what the minimum is for reliable operation.
8. PC serial port out can be +/-12V, which is much more than what the Arduino can tolerate.
9. ATmega328 first programmed on Arduino board (using USB) then placed in prototype board.
10. 16MHz crystal and two 30pF capacitors are required for the oscillator.
11. Place supply filter capacitors (tantalum, several uF) on analog and digital supplies
     close to the ATmega328 supply pins.
